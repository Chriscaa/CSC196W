	Virtual reality has come on leaps and bounds over the past few years. Whether we’re talking about the capabilities 		of the VR tech itself, its price, or the VR games now available to us, there’s no question that <strong>virtual 		reality has improved</strong>. While the Valve Index is still pricey, there are plenty of great budget options now 		available. The Oculus Quest 2 can be bought for a humble $300, and it’s a damn good headset by all technical 			standards.
	<br /> <br />
	What would it mean for our VR tech to become so good that VR games are indistinguishable from reality like this? 		Well, the game world would have to look and sound perfectly real, of course. That’s no small thing, either, because 		it’s difficult to see how even next-next-next-(and so on)-gen graphics and physics could perfectly emulate reality. 		But maybe it wouldn’t have to be exactly the same, maybe it could just be so immersive that it makes us feel like 		we’ve entered a new reality—one that’s slightly different from the real one.
	<br /> <br />
	Clearly there are hurdles to be overcome. Perhaps more importantly, however, there are questions about the very 		nature of VR tech and VR gaming that are often overlooked, but which are <strong>imperative for the VR 				gaming community to discuss</strong>. Will VR ever be good enough to imitate reality? And should we want it to?
